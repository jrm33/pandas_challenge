# pandas_challenge (Written Report)

READ ME:

In this challenge we were tasked to analyze a total of 15 schools across a school district. Breaking down the number of schools, students, scores for both math and reading, as well as the budgets. The first dataframe shows a breakdown of each school in the district. This is followed by a per school dataframe breaking down each school individually. Once the per school data frame was created, this gave us the data needed to sort the 5 highest and lowest performing schools based on overall passing. After sorting the top 5 highest and lowest performing schools we sorted each school by overall passing by grade for both math and reading scores.

WRITTEN REPORT:

After analyzing the data for the entire district and school breakdowns, the data concludes that charter schools performed at a significantly higher rate than district schools. The top 5 highest performing schools are all charter schools compared to the 5 lowest schools which are all district schools. Transitioning to the size of the school (student count per school), this data shows us that regardless of the spend, or the per student budget, schools with the least amount of students performed at a better rate than schools with a significantly higher per student count.
